Banking &amp; Finance Analytics Project

🚀 Banking & Finance Analytics Project | Data Analytics Portfolio

I recently completed an end-to-end Banking & Finance Analytics Project where I analyzed customer transactions, loan behavior, and financial risk patterns using Excel → Power BI.

🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer spending patterns, loan repayment behavior, and branch-level performance using a real-world–style synthetic banking dataset.
The goal was to derive insights that can help a bank improve customer engagement and reduce risk.

💼 Key Tasks Performed

✔ Cleaned and transformed 10,000+ customer transactions in Excel
✔ Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with:
